# Horiseon - Generating a Better Future

## Description 
This is my first attempt at creating a README for an HTML website. I made several changes:

    - Changed "search-engine-optimization" from to id so that when you click on the header you are directed to the class "search-engine-optimization"
    - Deleted the footer since it did not match the example given
    - Deleted some of the code for the footer since it was no longer applicable
    - Functionality of the website seemed congruent with the example given; ie the formatting works when you        change screen size
